Hello, Connention I am excited to share my latest Power BI project on Netflix stock market analysis! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

I'm thrilled to present my latest Power BI project, where I have delved into the world of stock market analysis, specifically focusing on Netflix. This comprehensive dashboard project covers the following key steps:

1. Excel Function Integration: 
  Leveraging Excel functions, I have implemented dynamic features such as Day, Month, Quarterly, and Yearly analyses to provide a comprehensive view of Netflix's stock market data over time.

2. Diverse Visualizations: 
  The dashboard incorporates various visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, slicers, and tables, to present the data clearly and insightfully, allowing for easy interpretation and analysis.

3. Stock Market Summary: 
  I have crafted visually appealing dashboards, styles, and reports in Power BI Desktop to provide a detailed overview of Netflix's stock market performance.


I look forward to sharing more insights and details about this project. Stay tuned for further updates, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more about this project or discuss potential collaborations!
